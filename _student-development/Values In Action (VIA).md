<p>At Bartley Secondary School, our students are empowered to serve their
community through our Values in Action (VIA) programme. These approaches
ensure that every Bartleyan can contribute meaningfully, develop leadership
skills, and make an impact at multiple levels through their specific talents
and collective school spirit.</p>
<p>At Bartley Secondary School, students engage in two pillars of VIA:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CCA-based VIA provides long-term, skill-based service, allowing students
to grow as leaders within their areas of expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School-wide VIA provides additional opportunities for one-off, collective
action, encouraging participation in causes that unite the entire school
community. (eg: National Day Food Donation Drive, Chinese New Year Handicraft)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Domain Leaders and the Student Council will take on greater responsibility
within both CCA-based and School-wide VIA. As student leaders, they will
guide and oversee VIA activities, setting examples for their peers and
facilitating a culture of active citizenship. Domain Leaders will leverage
their specialized knowledge to lead projects within their domains, while
the Student Council will support broader, school-wide initiatives. By taking
on these responsibilities, they not only enhance their leadership skills
but also deepen their commitment to meaningful, student-driven contribution</p>
<p>Together, these approaches ensure that every Bartleyan experiences meaningful
service and leadership development, preparing them to make a lasting impact
on both their local community and beyond.</p>

<p>The STEP framework integrates with Bartley’s Community Youth Leadership
programme, reinforcing the school’s mission to nurture empathetic, responsible,
and active contributors. It provides a structured pathway for students
to grow as leaders through meaningful service, with each CCA leveraging
its unique strengths to contribute to the community. This framework ensures
that students not only reflect on their experiences but also build the
skills and mindset needed for future leadership roles. Through this holistic
approach, Bartleyans are equipped not just to lead in the present but to
make a lasting, positive impact on society.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Holistic Leadership Development: The STEP framework aligns with Bartley’s
A3 approach to leadership. Students <strong>Acquire </strong>skills and
knowledge through their CCAs, <strong>Act</strong> on those skills by participating
in VIA projects, and <strong>Advocate</strong> by leading others, inspiring
positive change, and becoming agents of transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathy-Centered Leadership: At the heart of <strong>Service through Strength</strong>,
students develop as Leaders with Empathy, combining effectiveness with
compassion. They learn to serve not only with their talents but also with
understanding, ensuring that their contributions are meaningful and focused
on the needs of others.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We are delighted to announce that three students from Bartley Secondary
School, Pang Jia Zhen, Eryqa Hunsa, and Ellie Lee, have received recognition
at the esteemed Singapore Silent Heroes (SSH) Student Award 2025. The SSH
Student Award honours pupils for their selfless contributions to society.
By celebrating these acts of compassion, the award seeks to encourage others
to make positive contributions, fostering a spirit of giving that will
benefit future generations. These students demonstrate through their empathy
and bravery that genuine leadership lies not in seeking attention, but
in creating meaningful change in others' lives. As Jia Zhen, who is featured
in the Straits Times IN edition above, says, volunteerism “builds community
spirit and fosters a culture of care and responsibility”. Let’s celebrate
their spirit of service and the positive impact they have created in our
community. They are true examples of what it means to be Disciplined Learners,
Principled Leaders, and Compassionate Contributors.</p>

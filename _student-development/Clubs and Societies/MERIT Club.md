<h3>Vision:</h3>
<p>The Media Resource cum Information Technology Club (MERIT) is an active
learning hub that supports the students in their pursuit for learning with
its rich and varied resources. Students get opportunities to nurture their
love for photography, videography and computer applications and apply what
they learn by putting up varied photographic displays and creating short
films. The club also train responsible highly efficient members to provide
media support to ensure smooth running of events.</p>

<p><strong>About our CCA</strong> 
<br>The MeRIT Club is a vibrant and dynamic group of active learners and contributors
who are passionate about giving back to the community. Our team of dedicated
members plays a vital role in providing media support and showcasing their
photography skills during key school events and functions, such as Chinese
New Year, Racial Harmony Day, National Day, Commendation Day, and other
themed activities.</p>
<p>Our members are also trained to manage and set up lighting and sound systems
for the daily Morning Assembly, gaining valuable technical expertise. Additionally,
they seize opportunities to contribute their photographs to school publications,
enhancing their skills while leaving a meaningful impact.</p>
<p>Beyond school, members are encouraged to represent the club in prestigious
national-level competitions, including the Schools Digital Media Awards,
Ozone Video Creation, Digital for Life Video Creation, N.E.mation, and
the Singapore National Co-operative Federation competitions. These experiences
foster creativity, teamwork, and a competitive spirit.</p>
<p>The club also emphasizes community engagement through Values-in-Action
(VIA) activities. One notable initiative is the collaboration with IMDA,
SG Bono, and Vivita at Heartbeat@Bedok, where members facilitate and share
digital creative skills with the community. This project reflects the clubâ€™s
commitment to making a positive difference through technology and creativity.</p>
<p>The Media Club offers a platform for students to grow as creative leaders
and impactful contributors, equipping them with skills for the future while
inspiring a sense of purpose and collaboration.</p>

<h3>Vision:</h3>
<p>To nurture our basketball players into becoming a highly disciplined and
passionate team with a strong mindset which will lead us to glory</p>
<p><strong>Venue of Training:</strong> 
<br>Lower ISH Indoor basketball court</p>

<br>Mr Randy Chia</p>
<p><strong>CCA Teacher:</strong>

<p><strong>About us</strong> 
<br>Basketball team members are trained to develop and hone the basic basketball
skills of passing, shooting and dribbling. Opportunities are also available
for members to be nominated for First Aid Course as well as the Refereeing
Course for them to develop other skills on and off the court, as well as
the leadership positions of Captain and Vice-Captain. Above all, they are
taught to exercise discipline, resilience and teamwork through training.</p>
<p>Selected members of the team are sent to represent the school at the zonal
competitions each year. In addition, we also organise friendlies with other
schools to increase student exposure to match conditions. Players are also
given the opportunity to learn and keep track of statistics during matches,
where they can have a tangible understanding of their performance.</p>

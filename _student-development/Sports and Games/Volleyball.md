**About our CCA** <br>
In Volleyball, members will learn volleyball skills, as well as the rules and strategies of the game. Players are&nbsp;able to apply what they have learnt during the National School Games (NSG) and various friendly matches organised by organisations such as Mintonette and other secondary schools. Sportsmanship and resilience are key values in the team. Through participation in training and competitions, members build leadership skills and learn to work in teams, to strive to reach their fullest potential.

In addition, we believe in developing the leadership potential of our players through the various roles that they can engage&nbsp;in and uphold. We also actively contribute to the community and display service leadership by participating in Values-in-Action projects. They entail organising food donation drives in collaboration with Food from the Heart, Beach cleaning@East Coast Park and befriending the seniors at selected old folks homes.

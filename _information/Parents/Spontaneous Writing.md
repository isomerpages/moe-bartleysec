**Spontaneous Writing** <br>
Spontaneous Writing (SW) aims to develop Bartleyans into leaders who are able to think on their feet and write spontaneously on any given topic. SW develops fluency in writing and removes the hurdle of writers’ block. It is an opportunity for our students to develop critical and reflective thinking which they will be able to apply to various contexts in their lives.

**The Programme:** <br>
Students will write continuously for 35 minutes, every Friday, from 12.30 pm to 1.05 pm.

**Materials needed:** <br>
Spontaneous Writing Book <br>
SW Topics <br>
And most importantly, passion for writing.

**How to do it?** 
1. Don’t think – Write the first thing that comes to mind and keep going without thinking about what comes next.
2. Keep your hand moving – Once you start writing, don’t stop until the time is up.
3. Lose control – You’re free to write whatever you want.
4. Be specific – Not car, but Volkswagen, not dog, but golden retriever. 
5. Don’t worry about punctuation, spelling and grammar. 
6. You are free to write anything in the world.

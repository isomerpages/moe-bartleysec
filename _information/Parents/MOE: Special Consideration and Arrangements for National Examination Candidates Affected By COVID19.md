Dear Parent/Guardian

The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) have put in place arrangements for the coming national examinations for those who may be affected by COVID-19. 

**[Special Consideration (SC)]**

We understand that parents and students may be concerned about the impact on their child if they miss the national examinations due to COVID-19 reasons. We would like to assure you that candidates who miss any national examination paper(s) with valid reasons can apply for SC. SC is not a new practice. All SC applications are assessed on each case’s merit, and we will ensure that the grades awarded are as accurate and fair as possible. You can approach your child’s school for assistance with regards to the SC application.

**\[Candidates on Quarantine Order (QO) who want to take the national examinations\]**

While SC will be applied to cases with valid reasons, there may be some candidates who are on QO but still wish to take the national examinations. For this group of candidates, the Ministry of Health has approved a set of procedures for them to apply for leave from QO so that they can sit for their national examinations. This is an additional option made available to all national examination candidates this year. If your child is issued a QO, please inform your child’s school immediately so that the school can work with you to make the necessary arrangements.

Please see attachments for details on the arrangements and updates to the arrangements for candidates on Approved Absence. You can also go to [https://www.moe.gov.sg/faqs-covid-19-infection for FAQ on COVID-19](https://www.moe.gov.sg/faqs-covid-19-infection%20for%20FAQ%20on%20COVID-19) related matters. MOE and SEAB will monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and provide updates if there are further changes.

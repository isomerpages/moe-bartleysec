Dear Parents/Guardians,

The O-Level results will be released on Wednesday, 12 Jan 2022 at 2 p.m. Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know that they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define them or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions and be positive when deciding on their next steps.

Do take this opportunity to have further open conversations with your teen about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.

For more resources on providing social and emotional support, affirming your teen, and supporting your teen’s transition through post O-Level education, please refer to: [**https://go.gov.sg/selresforparent**s](https://go.gov.sg/selresforparents). You and your teen may also wish to refer to the What’s Next pamphlet ([**https://go.gov.sg/whats-next-olevel**](https://go.gov.sg/whats-next-olevel)) and available ECG resources on the MySkillsFuture Student Portal ([**https://go.gov.sg/MySFSec**](https://go.gov.sg/MySFSec)).

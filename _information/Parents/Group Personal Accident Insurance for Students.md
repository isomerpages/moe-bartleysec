claims records through the online portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that:
<br>a) All claims should be submitted as soon as possible, <u>preferably within 60 days</u> from

<p>b) All claims must be endorsed by the school.&nbsp; Please make sure that
a school incident report (with a simple case description) has been made
before submitting your claims.</p>
<p>c) Parents/guardian will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before
submitting claims to Income Insurance for reimbursement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Supporting documents include the medical bill with details of treatment
provided, medication dispensed from the hospital or clinic, showing payment
has been made. There should be no outstanding amount payable.</p>
<p>e) Parents/guardian should, where possible, avoid the use of private hospitals,
as the benefits under the GPA insurance plan may not fully cover the costs
at these hospitals.</p>

summary/day surgery report/attending physician’s medical report is required.</p>

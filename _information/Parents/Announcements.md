* For travel during the mid-year holidays, please declare your child/ward’s travel plan(s), indicating both the country and city of travel, and any city of transit, **by 27 May 2022 (Friday)**. Only one parent is required to declare.  

If your child/ward is **not travelling** during the holidays, **no action is required** on your side.

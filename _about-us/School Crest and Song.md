<h3>School Song</h3>
<p>Bartley school of Singapore
<br>Up and coming to the fore,
<br>Let us hail our alma mater ever more.
<br>Strong and steadfast we will be,
<br>Forge a strong community,
<br>With the links of friendship,
<br>Love and loyalty
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong> 
<br>Let’s cry “Facta Non Verba”
<br>And proclaim it near and far,
<br>Whether it be work or play
<br>We’ll go on from day to day,
<br>And be well-prepared
<br>To stand up to the fray
<br>
</p>
<p>Majulah Singapura
<br>Majulah Singapura
<br>That’s the cheer that links
<br>Our people near and far.
<br>Singapore will always be,
<br>Growing with prosperity,
<br>With the spirit that has
<br>Made us strong and free.
<br>
</p>

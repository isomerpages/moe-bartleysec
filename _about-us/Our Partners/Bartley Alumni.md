<p>Bartley Secondary School was formed in 1952 and the formation of the Old
Bartleyansâ€™ Association (OBA) was the brainchild of a group of enthusiastic,
dedicated and loyal students of the school in 1961.</p>
<p>The aim of the OBA was to be the bonding platform for former students
of the school to stay linked to the school. Through this platform, former
students can provide various support to the current students. In addition,
the OBA aims to work with the school to support its various programmes.</p>
<p>To remain relevant in the new millennia, the OBA has undertaken a name
change in 2013 to Bartley Alumni (BA) in a bid to attract the younger members
of graduates from Bartley Secondary School.</p>

##### Vision <br>
Leaders for Others, Learners for Others

#### Mission <br> 
Empowering Bartleyans to lead with effective and exceptional listening, reading, speaking and writing 

**By the end of a Bartleyan's education in Bartley Secondary School, a Bartleyan will be able to:**

* Listen, read and view critically and with accuracy, understanding and appreciating a wide range of literary and informational/ functional texts from print and non-print sources. 
* Speak fluently and write clearly, accurately and coherently, adapting their language and style in and for a range of purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures. 
* Acquire a wide vocabulary, an understanding of grammar and knowledge of linguistic conventions for reading, writing and spoken language.

##### Signature Programmes <br>
We constantly seek ways to engage and excite our students in the learning of the English Language. The design of the curriculum is grounded on the view that mastery of the English language enables the individual to make informed judgements about moral, philosophical and social issues, and develops his/her awareness of the self in relation to the diversity of human experience. A competence in language will also put our students in good stead in their chosen careers.

In the classroom, we continue to engage our students through the use of active and cooperative learning strategies, encouraging self-directed and collaborative learning. Similarly, thinking routines are also exploited to promote higher-order thinking and ownership of learning among students. All these initiatives among other things work toward developing students into 21st century learners who are equipped for future challenges.

Our signature programmes includes:

**Speak Up! Programme**

***eXciting Reading*** <br>
**1. Eat. Read. Connect. (ERC)** <br>
The Eat.Read.Connect (ERC) is a school-wide programme aimed at developing in students the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and information. Our students get the opportunity to read on a daily basis through the school's morning reading programme, while having their breakfast. At the same time, teachers use the time to engage students one-on-one to better understand and address individual needs.

**2. Reading Rejuvenation for Developing Readers** <br>
Students who require greater assistance in reading attend the Reading Rejuvenation Programme for developing readers. Students are led in reading deeper by a teacher mentor.

**3. Fun Reading** <br>
Various activities such as Reading Games Day, Tracking Reading Made Creative (creative displays of book reflections) as well as class library visits are organised to inculcate in students a love for reading.

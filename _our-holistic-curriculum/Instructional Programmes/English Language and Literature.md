</ul>
<h5>Signature Programmes <br></h5>
<p>We constantly seek ways to engage and excite our students in the learning
of the English Language. The design of the curriculum is grounded on the
view that mastery of the English language enables the individual to make
informed judgements about moral, philosophical and social issues, and develops
his/her awareness of the self in relation to the diversity of human experience.
A competence in language will also put our students in good stead in their
chosen careers.</p>
<p>In the classroom, we continue to engage our students through the use of
active and cooperative learning strategies, encouraging self-directed and
collaborative learning. Similarly, thinking routines are also exploited
to promote higher-order thinking and ownership of learning among students.
All these initiatives among other things work toward developing students
into 21st century learners who are equipped for future challenges.</p>
<p>Our signature programmes includes:</p>
<p><strong>Speak Up! Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Oracy skills are an integral feature of the Bartley EL curriculum. Hence,
the department has in place a progressive and development programme for
oracy skills.</p>
<p>Sec 1: Public Speaking and Puppetry for Confidence Building Sec 2: Young
Journalists and Drama for Artful Presentations Sec 3: Debating for Persuasive
Speaking Sec 4: Effective Communicator (Confident, Proficient and Persuasive
Speaker)</p>
<p><strong><em>eXciting Reading</em></strong> 
<br><strong>1. Eat. Read. Connect. (ERC)</strong> 
<br>The Eat.Read.Connect (ERC) is a school-wide programme aimed at developing
in students the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and
information. Our students get the opportunity to read on a daily basis
through the school's morning reading programme, while having their breakfast.
At the same time, teachers use the time to engage students one-on-one to
better understand and address individual needs.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reading Rejuvenation for Developing Readers</strong> 
<br>Students who require greater assistance in reading attend the Reading
Rejuvenation Programme for developing readers. Students are led in reading
deeper by a teacher mentor.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fun Reading</strong> 
<br>Various activities such as Reading Games Day, Tracking Reading Made Creative
(creative displays of book reflections) as well as class library visits
are organised to inculcate in students a love for reading.</p>
<p><strong>ELation!</strong>ELation is the school's very own English Language
Week. Teachers and students immerse themselves in a range of language-related
activities which include quizzes, drama presentations, poetry recital,
speeches as well as mini-competitions to showcase students' proficiency
in the language.</p>
<p><strong>Competitions:</strong>We strongly believe that our students need
to be exposed to good use of the language through their participation in
internal as well as external competitions. Hence, our students get to participate
in competitions such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debate Competition
and Destination Imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong>To promote aesthetic appreciation
and the use of language for artistic expressions, students undergo enrichment
programmes such as visits to plays, puppetry workshops, drama lessons as
well as debate skills training.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Writing</strong>Spontaneous Writing (SW) aims to develop
Bartleyans into leaders who are able to think on their feet and write spontaneously
on any given topic. SW develops fluency in writing and removes the hurdle
of writersâ€™ block. It is an opportunity for our students to develop critical
and reflective thinking which they will be able to apply to various contexts
in their lives.</p>

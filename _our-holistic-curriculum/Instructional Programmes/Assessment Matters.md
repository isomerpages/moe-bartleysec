### Assessment Plan and Policy 2023

1) The Ministry of Education announced in Sept 2018 changes to school-based assessment to shift away from over-emphasis on examinations and grades, and help students discover the joy of learning.

2)    In tandem with these changes, there will be only one weighted assessment per subject per term that counts towards the year-end overall score.  The school will undertake a range of formative assessment (e.g. pop quizzes, worksheets, seat work and homework) and reporting (e.g. termly and semestral progress reports) to inform and support student learning.

3)   In addition, there will be no mid-year examination for all levels..  

##### Attendance policy

4) Our teachers work hard to ignite passion and joy for learning in our students through meaningful and engaging learning experiences. Students can only benefit fully from these  learning experiences by being present, punctual and active in class.  

5) 
Every single day a child is absent from school is a day of learning lost.  Parents are to note the start and end dates of each term in the academic year.  All students are expected to be present and to attend lessons during term time, as well as all other school activities that have been planned for them.
 
6) A student’s attendance and punctuality are recorded in his/her academic report (termly and semestral) as the number of school days present and instances of late coming.

7) Students who did not attain at least a 75% in attendance may not be allowed to sit for exams.  Please note that absence from school shall be permitted when it is supported by a Medical Certificate (MC) or Parents Letter covering 4 days per semester only stating special reasons other than medical.

##### Absence from Weighted Assessment (WA) and Examinations** <br>
8)
If a student is unwell on the day of an assessment, he/she has to consult a doctor and get a medical certificate for the day of absence. The medical certificate must be submitted to the Form Teacher immediately when the student returns to school. Upon receipt of the medical certificate, the status of the assessment grade will be reflected as “MC”. Proration of marks, based on the other weighted assessments for the year, will be computed and reflected in the progress report accordingly. Only medical certificates issued by doctors registered with the Singapore Medical Council are accepted.
9) A student without a medical certificate will be given zero mark for the paper that he/she missed. Letters from parents will not be accepted. Any student who is absent for any WA/examination will not be able to sit for that particular paper and the paper will be given as a practice paper.  There is no retest or make-up test as this is consistent with that of the conduct of the national examinations where there is no re-take of examination paper missed.

10) All documents to validate a student’s absence from school must be submitted to the Form Teacher immediately, once the student returns to school.

11) The school’s practice to award zero mark for absence from assessment is to maintain the authenticity of the test/examination papers and ensure that there is fairness for all students who sat for the papers.    

12) We seek parents’/guardian’s cooperation NOT to send your child/ward to school for tests/examinations if he/she is unwell.  Do take your child/ward to the doctor when he/she is unwell and get a medical certificate so that the school can process the results accordingly.

**Parents’/Guardian’s Support** <br>
13) It is important that everyone works together to help every child obtain the best possible start in life with a good education.  Parents should work in partnership with the school, notifying the school of the reason for any of your child’s/ward’s absences and highlighting any areas of concern they may have so they can be addressed promptly.

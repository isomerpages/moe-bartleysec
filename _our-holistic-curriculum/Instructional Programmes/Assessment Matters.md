### Assessment Plan and Policy 2023

1) The Ministry of Education announced in Sept 2018 changes to school-based assessment to shift away from over-emphasis on examinations and grades, and help students discover the joy of learning.

2)    In tandem with these changes, there will be only one weighted assessment per subject per term that counts towards the year-end overall score.&nbsp; The school will undertake a range of formative assessment (e.g. pop quizzes, worksheets, seat work and homework) and reporting (e.g. termly and semestral progress reports) to inform and support student learning.

3)  &nbsp;In addition, there will be no mid-year examination for **all levels**.

##### Attendance policy

4) Our teachers work hard to ignite passion and joy for learning in our students through meaningful and engaging learning experiences. Students can only benefit fully from these &nbsp;learning experiences by being present, punctual and active in class.  

5) 
Every single day a child is absent from school is a day of learning lost.&nbsp; Parents are to note the start and end dates of each term in the academic year.&nbsp; All students are expected to be present and to attend lessons during term time, as well as all other school activities that have been planned for them.
 
6) A student’s attendance and punctuality are recorded in his/her academic report (termly and semestral) as the number of school days present and instances of late coming.

7) Students who did not attain at least a 75% in attendance may not be allowed to sit for exams.&nbsp; Please note that absence from school shall be permitted when it is supported by a Medical Certificate (MC) or Parents Letter covering 4 days per semester only stating special reasons other than medical.

##### Absence from Weighted Assessment (WA) and Examinations <br>
8) If a student is unwell on the day of an assessment, he/she has to consult a doctor and get a medical certificate for the day of absence. The medical certificate must be submitted to the Form Teacher immediately when the student returns to school. Upon receipt of the medical certificate, the status of the assessment grade will be reflected as “MC”. Proration of marks, based on the other weighted assessments for the year, will be computed and reflected in the progress report accordingly. Only medical certificates issued by doctors registered with the Singapore Medical Council are accepted.

9) For non-medical reasons, students are expected to notify the school of their absence through the Form Teacher at the earliest possible time. If the reason is accepted, the status of the assessment grade will be reflected as “VR” and proration of marks, based on the other weighted assessments for the year, will be computed and reflected in the progress report accordingly.

10) A student without a medical certificate or a valid reason will be given zero mark for the paper that he/she has missed. Letters from parents will not be accepted. This is to maintain the authenticity of the test/examination papers and to ensure fairness for all students who have prepared and sat for the papers. While there is no retest or make-up test, students who are absent from the WAs/ examination will be given the paper for practice when he/she returns to school.

11) WAs and examinations are important checkpoints for students to gauge their learning progress and for teachers to identify learning gaps and conduct remediation. Students are expected to put in effort to prepare and revise for the assessment and be present on days of assessment. Students who miss more than 25% of the assessment for any subject in a year will not be eligible for school-based academic awards.

##### Parent/Guardian Support 

12) The school firmly believes in a tripartite partnership where parents work closely with the school to nurture and ensure that our students obtain the best possible start in life and learn the right values, skills, attitudes and behaviours. Hence, parents should notify the school the reason for f their child’s/ward’s absence and highlight any areas of concern they may have so that these can be addressed promptly.

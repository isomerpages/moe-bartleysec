### Assessment Plan and Policy 2022

1. The Ministry of Education announced in Sept 2018 several changes to encourage schools and stakeholders to move away from focusing too much on examinations and grades, and to help students to discover the joy of learning.

2. In tandem with these changes, there will be only one weighted assessment per subject per term that counts towards the year-end score.  The school will undertake a range of student assessment (e.g. pop quizzes, worksheets, seat work and homework) and reporting (e.g. termly and semestral progress reports) to inform and support student learning. 

3. In addition, there will be no mid-year examination at Secondary 1 and 3.  

**Attendance Policy** <br>
4. The staff of Bartley Secondary School works hard to design interesting and engaging programmes so that learning is meaningful to ignite the passion and joy for learning in our students.  Students can only benefit fully from these programmes by being present, punctual and participating actively in all school programmes.  

5. Every single day a child is absent from school equates to a day of lost learning.  Parents are to note the start and end dates of each term in the academic year.  All students are expected to be present and to attend lessons during term time, as well as all other school activities that have been planned for them.
 
6. A student’s attendance and punctuality are recorded in his/her academic report (termly and semestral) as the number of school days present and instances of late coming. 

7. In order to sit for examinations, students have to attain at least 75% in attendance.  In other words, their absence accounted for by medical certificates and parent’s letters must not exceed 25%.  The school will only accept a maximum of 4 parents’ / guardian’s letter per year.

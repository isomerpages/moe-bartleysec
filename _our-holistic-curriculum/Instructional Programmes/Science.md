### Vision
Leaders for Others, Learners for Life

### Mission
To nurture inquisitive minds and inculcate Bartleyans with relevant Scientific knowledge, skills and values by providing meaningful and engaging experiences via the processes of inquiry

**By the end of a Bartleyan's education in Bartley Secondary School, a Bartleyan will be able to:**

* Become confident citizens in a technological world, able to take or develop an informed interest in matters of scientific importance 
* Recognise the usefulness, and limitations, of scientific methods and models and to appreciate their applicability in other disciplines and in everyday life 
* Be suitably prepared for studies beyond this level in the sciences, applied sciences or in science-related courses.

### Signature Programmes
**1. Competitions** <br>
The department hopes to develop and stretch high-ability students by participating in national competitions. It is hoped that the experience gained will be beneficial to our students in their future endeavours. Some of the competitions that we have participated in, include;

1. IgNITE Skills Challenge
2. Chemical-Powered Car Competition
3. UNSW Science Competition

**2. Young Engineers Award (YEA)** <br>
The department partners Singapore Polytechnic (School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering) and STEM Inc. Singapore Science Centre to enable our students to self-discover and arouse their interest in Science and Engineering through the YEA. All secondary 1 and 2 students will have the opportunity to attain the YEA (Applied Learning) upon completion of the ALP curriculum. Students who exhibit higher aptitude and positive attitude towards the ALP will be invited to participate in the Tier 2 programme and apply for the YEA (Achievement).

**3. STEM Enrichment Courses for Secondary 3 Students** <br>
To make learning authentic and relevant for our students, the Science department provides the opportunity for secondary 3 students to experience the application of Science concepts in tertiary institutions as well as in industries. Examples of learning journeys the students have participated in, includes;
* Translational Laboratory in Genetic Medicine (TLCM)

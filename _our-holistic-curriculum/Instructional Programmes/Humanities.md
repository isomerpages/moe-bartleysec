### Vision
The Humanities Department strives to develop students'
understanding and appreciation of the environmental, political and socio-cultural inheritance of our nation from a global perspective.

### Mission
The Inquiry approach leveraging on experiential learning is advocated by the department to imbue Bartleyans with realistic comprehension of the world around them by expounding the knowledge acquired in the classroom. It is also the undertaking of the department to develop the academic potential of our students as we believe that each Bartleyan can excel.

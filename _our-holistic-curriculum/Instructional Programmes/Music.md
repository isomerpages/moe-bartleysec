### Our Key Programmes & Events

**General Music Programme (GMP)** <br> 
The GMP aims to develop in students an awareness and appreciation of music from various cultures, and the ability to creatively express themselves through music making and creation. This provides Bartleyans a basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music. Over the 2 years in their lower secondary, the teaching and learning of music is guided by the following types of musical activities:

* Listening and responding to music
* Creating music
* Performing music

Bartleyans can expect to learn the following music modules as part of their 2-year GMP:

**At Sec 1:**
* Elements of music
* Rhythmic games, body percussion, music-making using classroom instruments
* Film music and its industry
* Instruments of the orchestra
* Pop piano playing
* Dikir Barat
* Xinyao
* Indian classical music

Students are assessed through written tests, projects submissions and/or performances.

**Taking MEP outside Bartley Secondary School** <br>
Interested students who have shown good music aptitude may be recommended to further their musical learning, by applying for the 4-year (starts in Sec 1) or 2-year (starts in Sec 3) MEP (Music Elective Programme). Bartleyans under this programme will still undergo the above GMP lessons, and will be well supported by the music teacher at Bartley Secondary School.

*Note: Bartley Secondary School is **NOT** an MEP centre. Students will travel to another school to learn music as an additional subject. More information may be found here: https://bit.ly/2PbG10O (4-year MEP).*

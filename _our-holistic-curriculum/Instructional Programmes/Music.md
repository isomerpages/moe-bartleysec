<h3>Our Key Programmes &amp; Events</h3>
<p><strong>General Music Programme (GMP)</strong> 
<br>The GMP aims to develop in students an awareness and appreciation of music
from various cultures, and the ability to creatively express themselves
through music making and creation. This provides Bartleyans a basis to
develop an informed and life-long involvement in music. Over the 2 years
in their lower secondary, the teaching and learning of music is guided
by the following types of musical activities:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Listening and responding to music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performing music</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bartleyans can expect to learn the following music modules as part of
their 2-year GMP:</p>
<p><strong>At Sec 1:</strong>
</p>

<p>Students are assessed through written tests, projects submissions and/or
performances.</p>
<p><strong>Taking MEP outside Bartley Secondary School</strong> 
<br>Interested students who have shown good music aptitude may be recommended
to further their musical learning, by applying for the 4-year (starts in
Sec 1) or 2-year (starts in Sec 3) MEP (Music Elective Programme). Bartleyans
under this programme will still undergo the above GMP lessons, and will
be well supported by the music teacher at Bartley Secondary School.</p>
<p><em>Note: Bartley Secondary School is </em><strong><em>NOT</em></strong><em> an MEP centre. Students will travel to another school to learn music as an additional subject. More information may be found here: https://bit.ly/2PbG10O (4-year MEP).</em>

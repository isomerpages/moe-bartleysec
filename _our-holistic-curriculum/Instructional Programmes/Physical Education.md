##### Our Key Programmes and Events

**PE National Curriculum**

Our department is committed to provide an enriching curriculum to enhance studentsâ€™ experiences in Physical Education (PE). PE teachers consciously make use of movement as the primary medium to develop Bartleyans through the following:

* Education in movement (acquisition and mastery of fundamental and specialized skills);
* Education through movement (acquisition and development of knowledge and psychosocial skills); and
* Education about movement (nurturing of values to attain desirable health-related fitness).

As students move on to the secondary school level, the teachers will build on the foundation and apply their knowledge and skills from the three learning areas of Physical Health and Fitness, Outdoor Education and Physical Activities in authentic settings.

Bartleyans attain the following sports skills during their time at Bartley Secondary School in the aim that they will continue to play the game during their lifetime.

* Sec 1: Netball and Badminton
* Sec 2: Ultimate Frisbee and Football
* Sec 3: Tag Rugby and Softball
* Sec 4: Floorball and Volleyball
* Sec 5: Tchoukball

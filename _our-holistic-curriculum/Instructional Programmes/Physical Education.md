##### Our Key Programmes and Events

**PE National Curriculum**

Our department is committed to provide an enriching curriculum to enhance students’ experiences in Physical Education (PE). PE teachers consciously make use of movement as the primary medium to develop Bartleyans through the following:

* Education in movement (acquisition and mastery of fundamental and specialized skills);
* Education through movement (acquisition and development of knowledge and psychosocial skills); and
* Education about movement (nurturing of values to attain desirable health-related fitness).

As students move on to the secondary school level, the teachers will build on the foundation and apply their knowledge and skills from the three learning areas of Physical Health and Fitness, Outdoor Education and Physical Activities in authentic settings.

Bartleyans attain the following sports skills during their time at Bartley Secondary School in the aim that they will continue to play the game during their lifetime.

* Sec 1: Netball and Badminton
* Sec 2: Ultimate Frisbee and Football
* Sec 3: Tag Rugby and Softball
* Sec 4: Floorball and Volleyball
* Sec 5: Tchoukball

**Bartley Road Run**

It is our annual key event which provides an opportunity for Bartleyan to compete with sportsmanship, cultivate a healthy attitude towards exercise and bond together as a class. Over the years, we have held the event at various location around Singapore including Bedok Reservoir, Sengkang Riverside Park and at the Sports Hub. Besides students, teaching staff, alumni, parents and members of the parent support group also participate actively in the various race categories.

**BSS 10 minute Running Challenge.**

During the post-circuit breaker period, the new normal is to improvise lessons adhering to the Safe Management Measures within safe distancing guidelines. Hence the usual mass sporting events was not feasible. The PE team planned for a running league spanning over 4 weeks where individual students clocked as much distance as they could and the total mileage for the classes was consolidated. The total distance clocked was divided by the total number of runners in the class to obtain an average distance per runner. Some of the classes reported 60-70km per running session and it was extremely heartening to see the students having fun and working together as a class towards a common goal. The PE department continuously promoted active and healthy lifestyle even during these uncertain times.

**Secondary Two Adventure Camp**

All Bartleyans are given an opporunity to participate in at least 2 Adventure Overnight Camps during their time at Bartley Secondary School. One of which will be during the 3D2N Sec 2 Adventure Camp held annually at an Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (MOE). The camp serves as an extension platform for students to demonstrate their outdoor education skills in authentic learning scenario. The camp is organized by the PE department and fully facilitated by form teachers and camp instructors. Students participated in activities such as Abseiling, Artificial Caving System, Flying Fox Kayaking, High Elements Adventure tower, Outdoor Cooking, OE Amazing Race and Mass Campfire session. These activities aims to help students be resilient when faced with challenges, be physically active through outdoor activities and create meaningful memories with their classmates.

**Inter-Class Games**

Typically held at the end of each semester, the inter-class games allows students to demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired from the structured modular sports system. In addition, the games provides opportunity for nurturing of sportsmanship and school core values and not just winning the game. It is also about the friendship that is forged when a team is formed and challenged to work towards a common goal.

**Assembly PE Messages**

The PE department engages the whole school - student and staff on topics governing holistic health. From debunking exercise myths to tips for NAPFA, the PE Leaders shared bite size exercise and health information to enrich Bartleyan’s general knowledge of physical health and fitness during the assembly.

**Sports Fiesta**

As part of the PE department’s effort to promote mass participation and friendly competition, the PE teachers also organized the Sports Fiesta on the last day of Term 3. The event aims to provide more playing opportunities for students of different sporting ability as the focus is on mass participation and class bonding. The event typically consists of modified games such as water soccer, dodgeball, street bandy and Captain’s ball. During the fiesta, the form teachers team up with their class to play and unwind after a busy term.

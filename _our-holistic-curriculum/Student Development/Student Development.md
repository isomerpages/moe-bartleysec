### BARTLEY SECONDARY SCHOOL’S CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

**ACQUIRE, APPLY, ASSESS, ADJUST**
![](/images/assess-adjust_images_thumb_medium300_200.png)

**1) Arrangement & Colours** <br>
a. The centre represents the programmes we have in place to help our students acquire our core values, and forge their moral anchor. It is coloured bright yellow, signifying Strength and Steadfastness on our school crest (CCE Outcome 2).

b. The red layer refers to the programmes or concepts that the school uses to help our students acquire and develop their social-emotional (SE) competencies, which are related to Identity, Relationships and Choices (CCE Outcomes 1,3,4). These are linked to the virtues of Friendship, Love, Loyalty & Brotherhood represented by the Red on our crest.

c. The academic and non-academic programmes in our school are spread out across the SPACE (social, physical, aesthetic, cognitive, emotional) domains, and are a balanced approach to help to students apply the values and social-emotional competencies in the context of School. The White represents Honesty in our search of knowledge and ourselves.

d. The blue circle refers to the platforms that give students opportunities to think and act beyond themselves and their immediate surroundings, giving of themselves to the nation and the world (CCE Outcomes 4,5,6,7,8). The Deep Blue represents a Bright and Fruitful Future, not just for Bartleyans, but for Bartley and the Singapore as well.

e. The outermost circle reminds our students to be Resilient and Responsible Leaders by assessing their performance and behaviour, and making the necessary adjustments to achieve the school’s vision of being a Value-Added School with a High Performing Culture. The White here reiterates the importance of Honesty in this process of Life-Long Learning.

### Student Leadership Development (SLD)
At Bartley, we believe that every student has the potential to be a strong self-leader, and a leader for others. As such, the school has identified Student Leadership Development to be one of our key student development platforms. To this end, we have SLD programmes targeted at the whole student body, and for students on our Student Leadership Tracks.

| Level | Level Outcome | Mass Programme | SL Track Programme |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Responsible Leaders of Self | 7 Habits<br>Traits of Ethical Leaders | Mixed of customised and cohort-based programmes for<br>1. Student Councillors,<br>2. CCA Leaders,<br>3. Class Chairs, and<br>4. Domain Experts |

| 3 | Resilient Leaders for Change | 6 Decisions<br>Traits of Transformational Leaders |  |
| 4/5 | Resilient Leaders for Excellence | 6 Decisions<br>Traits of Mentors |  |
| | | | |

### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
To augment our students' home values, CCE lessons provide a platform for the development of character, social-emotional competencies and national values within our students. These lessons are developed by MOE’s Character and Citizenship Education Branch (CCEB) so that the delivered curriculum is holistic and engaging, inspiring and insightful.
 

To augment CCE, Citizenship Education (formerly National Education) programmes are crafted for the development of students in Bartley Secondary School in understanding their roles as citizens of and residents in Singapore.  The programmes are purposefully tailored to meet the developmental needs of our students from Sec 1 to Sec 5, and to instil in students a strong sense of Active Citizenry.

### Student Development Programmes
MOE and Bartley Secondary School firmly believe that character development should be both taught (through explicit teaching of values and social-emotional skills) and caught (through experiential learning).

The overall outcome of these programmes is a Resilient and Responsible Leader in every Bartleyan. To achieve this main outcome, all programmes in the school are geared towards the following level outcomes:

Sec 1:             Responsible Leaders of Self <br>
Sec 2:             Responsible Leaders for Others <br>
Sec 3:             Resilient Leaders for Change <br>
Sec 4/5:          Resilient Leaders for Excellence <br>

### Values-in-Action (VIA, previously Community Involvement Programme, CIP)
VIA provides students opportunities to develop a sense of belonging and purpose to the community they live in and society at large. Through their projects, students understand the roles they play in improving their surrounding environment. It is also a platform for students to actualise the social-emotional competencies to allow a developmental avenue for Character Education.

### Education & Career Guidance (ECG) Modules & Programmes
ECG helps students make informed educational and career progression decisions and choices. In Bartley, this is done through direct guidance, profiling tools, fairs, progression talks and work experiences. Our tie-ups with post-secondary educational institutions allow us to help our students begin with the end in mind.

### Sexuality Education (SEd) Modules
Please see our tab on Sexuality Education.

### School-based CCE, including Assembly programmes and Form Teacher Period
To complement MOE’s offerings, the school has additional programmes to achieve our overall outcome of Resilient and Responsible Leaders. As mentioned, the 7 Habits and 6 Decisions programmes foster personal leadership within our students. The Leadership Talks aim to equip our students with knowledge of current literature on the types of leaders. Our signature SMILE@Bartley is explained further below. Other programmes are incorporated on a timely basis.   

**SMILE@Bartley - Student Mentoring through Innovative Learning Experiences**

SMILE provides an environment and support infrastructure that is conducive for students to achieve greater success. This is done through a small group mentorship programme, during which the close interaction allows an in-depth understanding of the cognitive, social-emotional and physical challenges that students face. The rapport between role models and the students provides the important emotional support amidst the academic rigour.

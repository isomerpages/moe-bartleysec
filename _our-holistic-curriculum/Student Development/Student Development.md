### BARTLEY SECONDARY SCHOOL’S CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

**ACQUIRE, APPLY, ASSESS, ADJUST**
![](/images/assess-adjust_images_thumb_medium300_200.png)

**1. Arrangement & Colours** <br>
a. The centre represents the programmes we have in place to help our students acquire our core values, and forge their moral anchor. It is coloured bright yellow, signifying Strength and Steadfastness on our school crest (CCE Outcome 2).

b. The red layer refers to the programmes or concepts that the school uses to help our students acquire and develop their social-emotional (SE) competencies, which are related to Identity, Relationships and Choices (CCE Outcomes 1,3,4). These are linked to the virtues of Friendship, Love, Loyalty & Brotherhood represented by the Red on our crest.

c. The academic and non-academic programmes in our school are spread out across the SPACE (social, physical, aesthetic, cognitive, emotional) domains, and are a balanced approach to help to students apply the values and social-emotional competencies in the context of School. The White represents Honesty in our search of knowledge and ourselves.

d. The blue circle refers to the platforms that give students opportunities to think and act beyond themselves and their immediate surroundings, giving of themselves to the nation and the world (CCE Outcomes 4,5,6,7,8). The Deep Blue represents a Bright and Fruitful Future, not just for Bartleyans, but for Bartley and the Singapore as well.

e. The outermost circle reminds our students to be Resilient and Responsible Leaders by assessing their performance and behaviour, and making the necessary adjustments to achieve the school’s vision of being a Value-Added School with a High Performing Culture. The White here reiterates the importance of Honesty in this process of Life-Long Learning.

2. This table presents the different programmes that go in each layer.

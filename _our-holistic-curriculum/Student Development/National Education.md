**NE Week (17 July - 21 July 2017) <br>
Theme: The Singapore Way**

As we make the journey from tolerating differences to embracing diversity, our Singapore identity continues to develop.  It is important that Racial Harmony is part of this identity and way of life.  We continually strive to deepen bonds across and amongst communities.  It is important that our youth, on whose shoulders our future lies, make Racial Harmony a key aspect of their hopes and dreams for what Singapore is and could be.

**BARTLEY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK (BCF)** <br>
The Bartley Curriculum Framework defines the school’s approaches and outcomes and sets the direction, for excellence in teaching and learning.  It guides the school in delivering a quality student-centric, values-driven and holistic education.

* The BCF is designed to be in a shape of a star and compass.
* It is likened to that of a Polaris or more commonly known as the North Star. The North Star has been used for well over 2000 years by navigators to determine both their direction and latitude.
* The BCF thus provides the direction for the school in the design and delivery of its programme, both in curricular and co-curricular areas
* The BCF has 5 parts: 
	* Innermost circle for **Values** 
	* The heptagon for **Habits**
	* The hexagon for **Competencies**
	* The 6-pointed star for **Approaches**; and
	* The wheel for **Mission** and **Value Proposition**
	* The implementation of the BCF will help deliver the desired outcome of a Bartleyan education, captured in the wheel at the base of the model

The BCF is centred on the school’s **CORE VALUES**.  These values form the foundation of our efforts to nurture our students.

Students are also equipped with social-emotional competencies, and 21st century skills to help them navigate through life successfully. **COMPETENCIES** are abilities or attributes, described in terms of behaviour, which are key to highly effective performance.

The school’s effort in curriculum planning and design is based on the **X3-A3 APPROACH**.  For academic programme, the curriculum is designed with the intent to e**X**cite and engage students in their learning, provide avenues for them to e**X**tend and apply what they have learnt, and give opportunities for all students to e**X**cel and experience success.  In the co-curricular domain, the design of the curriculum is tailored to enable students to **A**cquire knowledge and skills, provide opportunities for them to **A**ct on what they have learnt, and equip them with skills so that they can be a champion and **A**dvocate for positive change.

In enacting the curriculum, the school is guided by our **MISSION** of empowering every Bartleyan to lead with wisdom, serve with humility and learn with passion.  Through this framework, we want to deliver on our **VALUE PROPOSITION** of nurturing Bartleyans to be Leaders for Others, Learners for Life.

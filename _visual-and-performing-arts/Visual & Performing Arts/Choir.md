**About our CCA** <br>
Choir is a CCA that allows its members to have fun and acquire basic music skills and vocal techniques. Students are given opportunities to develop musically and hone their skills through participation in school events and public performances. Participation in the SYF Arts Presentation and regular Choir Exchange programmes conducted with other schools also allows students to benchmark their skills with other choirs and gain a wider perspective. Choir outings are held to bond the members and expose the students to a variety of choral concerts. Ultimately, the CCA hopes to promotes the gift of music as a lifelong skill.

**Our objectives:** 
* To develop lifelong friendship amongst members.
* To learn basic music and vocal skills.
* To showcase student's talents in school events and public performance.
* To participate and represent the school in the Singapore Youth Festival.
* To promote and appreciate the gift of music as a lifelong skill.

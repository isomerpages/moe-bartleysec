**About our CCA** <br>
BSS Modern Dance Club was newly inaugurated in 2016. All members go through weekly training by full time instructor. 
Bartleyâ€™s Modern Dance Club comprises of boys and girls who show enthusiasm and a passion for dance. We focus more on ballet and contemporary techniques, as well as occasionally exposing the dancers to other genre of dances. We promote dance as a form of art beyond its aesthetic value. We are optimistic that each individual can dance and embark on the gracious journey together to discover their potential beyond dance. As they work towards a common goal of attaining excellence they also forge stronger bonds and great team work among themselves.

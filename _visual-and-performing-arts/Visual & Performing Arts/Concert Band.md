**About our CCA** <br>
Bartley Concert Band aims to equip students with musical skills and excel in every performance. Through the band practices, students learn not only music and how to play the scores well, but also learn the values of discipline, dedication, perseverance and teamwork. To showcase their talents, they participate in numerous national competitions as well as internal and external performances. Students also participate in school exchange programmes where they share and learn new things from their counterparts in other schools. To further equip them with musical skills, band tutors are engaged for various sections, and students are given the exposure of external music workshops and masterclasses conducted by renowned international conductors. To develop their leadership skills, the band leaders are nominated for the annual camps such as the school student leaders’ combined camp as well as the Drum Major’s Camp or the Combined Music CCA Leadership Camp.
Many activities are organised for the band members to develop and demonstrate various values and talents throughout their four years in the Concert Band. These include intersectional games, camps, outings and exchanges as well as public performances.

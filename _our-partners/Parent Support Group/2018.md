##### Activities done by the PSG for 2018 

**1) Welcome Tea for New PSG members** <br>
On this day, we welcome our new PSG members to the Bartley family. We had our Vice-Principal, Mrs Tan, to speak to parents about the importance of parentsâ€™ involvement in their school activity. We then had a sharing session by former PSG member, Ms Pamela and Ms Gek Hwa. Some PSG members also shared their aspirations and motivations behind joining the PSG.

Our PSG members are actively helping out in school events. The school appreciates the kind support in school events and programmes.

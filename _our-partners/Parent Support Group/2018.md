##### Activities done by the PSG for 2018 

**1) Welcome Tea for New PSG members** <br>
On this day, we welcome our new PSG members to the Bartley family. We had our Vice-Principal, Mrs Tan, to speak to parents about the importance of parents’ involvement in their school activity. We then had a sharing session by former PSG member, Ms Pamela and Ms Gek Hwa. Some PSG members also shared their aspirations and motivations behind joining the PSG.

**i) Bartley Road Run** <br>
The PSG provided assistance as road marshals for the school’s annual X-Country Run around Bedok Reservoir. Their support and presence helped to give the final push for the students to complete the final lap of the race. 

**ii) National Day celebrations** <br> 
Our members came down to add to the festivities of the National Day celebrations where residents from NKF and Tembusu Resident’s Centre joined in the school in the celebrations as well. Our members then assist in the reception for our guests and interacted with them to ensure that they feel at ease

**3) Education and Career Guidance Workshop** <br>
Our members gathered valuable knowledge about the different pathways available to students after they graduate. In addition, this workshop provided guidelines on how to identify your child’s strengths and what you can do as a parent to work on your child’s weakness(es). Overall, our members had a fruitful session during the workshop. 

**4) PSG Bonding – Teacher’s Day gift-making** <br> 
Our PSG members came together to make gifts for Teacher’s Day to show appreciation for the educators who is shaping their children’s lives. It was a good chance for members to impart the value of gratitude in their children through this short activities.

Bartley Secondary School is one of the 30+ secondary schools which will be implementing Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2023.

Purpose of Full SBB
-------------------

  
Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.  

By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

*   Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2; and
*   Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.

  

The following video explains the purpose of FSBB

How does Full SBB look like in Bartley Secondary School?
--------------------------------------------------------

| **Aspect of Full SBB**| **How will this aspect be implemented?** |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Mixed form classes**     | **Mixed Form Class**<br><br>The 2023 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be placed in mixed form classes. Each of these classes comprises students from different courses of study.<br><br> Every class will have 2 Form Teachers and students get to participate in a wide range of school programmes throughout the year as a class. Being in mixed form classes also present more opportunities for students to interact with other students who may be taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.     | 
|**Academic Learning**|Students will have more opportunities to learn subjects together as a form class. These subjects are:  Art, Character and Citizenship Education, Deign and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music & Physical Education.<br><br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.  <br><br>Student will learn English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, Science and Humanities based on your course of study.  <br><br>The criteria for taking English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject.  <br><br>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.
|**Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2**|At Bartley Sec, we will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects, namely History and Geography, at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria. This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) course from 2023, and students who are in the Sec 2 Normal (Technical) course from 2024.<br><br>The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students’ aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1. They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.

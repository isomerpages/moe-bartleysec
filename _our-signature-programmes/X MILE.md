<p><strong>Aim of the Programme</strong> 
<br>X-SMILE @ Bartley aims to heighten students’ awareness of and belief in
themselves. Through a guided process of self-discovery, each pupil will
realise he/she is both the limiting factor to and the activator of his/her
own success. This is when the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Youths will
be brought to play.</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong> 
<br>As our students enter their graduation year, the pressure rises very quickly.
Amidst the hustle and bustle of studies and examinations, it is easy to
lose track of other important things in life, including family, friends,
what students are truly studying for, and leaving behind a strong legacy
of excellence. Form Teachers of graduating classes and various Key Personnel
will be assigned as mentors to groups of graduating students, helping them
reflect on their time in Bartley, envision their goals in life, and activate
their strengths, interests and passions to pursue excellence.</p>
<p>Throughout a student’s journey in Bartley, he/she would have been exposed
and educated in the 7 Habits. In the final year, all these 7 Habits will
be explicitly brought together. Using Habits 1-3 (Be Proactive, Begin with
the End in Mind, Put First Things First), students go a thorough goal-
and target-setting process with their mentors and parents, and learn to
prioritise their ‘big rocks’.</p>
<p>Bartley supplements this mentor guidance process with a Success Camp,
during which students will learn practical study and life skills and knowledge.
These will cement their goals and targets, and help hone their prioritisation
skills. The camp will also begin to activate the next three habits (Think
Win-Win, Seek First to Understand Then to be Understood, and Synergise),
as students are made aware of their strengths and areas for improvements,
and encouraged to seek out study group mates who will cover their ‘blind
spots’.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the mentorship process will help students to Sharpen
their Saws (Habit 7), not just in the academic domain, but in the social
and emotional domains as well. They will be encouraged to keep their attention
on their targets, work through issues with family members, peers and other
significant people in their lives, and maintain a sense of positivity.
The small group mentorship structure promotes a close interaction, allowing
an in-depth understanding of the challenges that students face as a young
individual trying to find his/herself in society and the world. It also
aims to foster a strong sense of camaraderie among students, with the mentor,
and with Bartley, so that they will return to contribute as Alumni.</p>

**What is the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) of Bartley?** <br>
**Learning for Life Programme**

**Community and Youth Leadership** <br>
The Learning for Life Programme in Community and Youth Leadership (CYL) embodies the school’s mission of nurturing wise leaders with the passion to serve the community. This is also in line with our long-term goal of developing students to be servant leaders. Through structured leadership training, learning programmes and opportunities, the school hopes to nurture individuals who are concerned citizens who actively contribute and selflessly give their time and energy to help others. The school strongly believes that leadership is not about the accumulation and exercise of power, but the natural feeling that one wants to serve, and care for others.

The objectives of this programme are:

* To develop leadership skills, knowledge and competencies that will strengthen students ability to serve the community.  
* To provide the opportunities for students to apply their learning in authentic community platforms
* To empower students to initiate and lead in community experiences
 
To enhance students’ experience and learning, we have partnered with community and voluntary welfare organisations, which include the South East CDC, Joo Seng RC, Macpherson Gardens NC, NEA, HDB and Waterways Watch Society. These partnerships aim to give student leaders a stronger community service angle in their growth towards becoming Leaders for others.

We have different leadership and community VIA projects for the different levels. There are mass leadership workshops where each level of students will learn the traits of being a servant leader.
* Secondary 1 – Awareness and listening skills (Working in teams for a good cause)
* Secondary 2 - Perspective taking and empathy (Understanding needs of community and planning activities that would meet the needs and interests)
* Secondary 3 – Planning and executing a VIA project
* Secondary 4/5 – Leading a student –initiated project and inspiring others towards a good cause

**Apex leadership training** is done for student leaders to deepen their understanding and in inspiring them to take the lead in serving the community. There are camps organised for deeper learning and involvement in community projects beyond the school projects.  

--------------

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP)** <br>
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) of Bartley Secondary School is on Chemical and Applied Sciences (Fragrance). The programme aims to equip our students with knowledge and skills in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) domain. Students will get to acquire concepts on Fragrances and engage in practical experiments to extract essential oils from flowers, fruits and spices. They will learn to create 3D designs using TinkerCAD software and print the designs out using 3D printers. They will get to formulate their personalised fragrance based on their personality and engage in Design-Thinking processes to create a product based on the theme specified.

Our Educational Partner, A\*star, collaborates with the school in research projects in which the students take on the role of research scientists and conduct experiments to deepen their knowledge and sharpen their skills in STEM. Our industrial partner, Takasago, is the leading fragrance company in Asia and has given our students the opportunity to visit its facilities and to learn more about the processes of manufacturing fragrances. Some students will be identified in Sec two and three to take up an Advanced Elective Module (AEM) on Perfumery in Singapore Polytechnic or to participate in STEM-related competitions and research programmes as means to pursue their interest in that field of study.

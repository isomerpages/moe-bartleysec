<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>Are you keen to help your child transition better into Secondary School?
Are you interested to meet other parents to exchange advice on engaging
your teenager? Would you like to be a supportive partner of Bartley Secondary
School to help make it the best “home away from home” for your child?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of the above, then join the Bartley Parent
Support Group today! You can email your interest to the PSG Chairperson,
Ms Shauna Sng, at <strong><a href="mailto:bartley.psg@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bartley.psg@gmail.com</a></strong>.
We look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

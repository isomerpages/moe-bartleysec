<p><strong>Mixed Form Class</strong>
<br>
<br>The 2025 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be placed in mixed form classes.
Each of these classes comprises students from different courses of study.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Every class will have 2 Form Teachers and students get to participate
in a wide range of school programmes throughout the year as a class. Being
in mixed form classes also present more opportunities for students to interact
with other students who may be taking different subject combinations, and
with different strengths and interests.</p>

<p>Students will have more opportunities to learn subjects together as a
form class. These subjects are:&nbsp; Art, Character and Citizenship Education,
Deign and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music &amp; Physical
Education.
<br>
<br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.
<br>
<br>Student will learn English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics,
Science and Humanities based on your course of study.
<br>
<br>The criteria for taking English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics
and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is
based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject.
<br>
<br>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects
at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>At Bartley Sec, we will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity
to take Humanities subjects, namely History and Geography, at a more demanding
level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.
<br>
<br>The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based
on students’ aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1.
They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong
commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.</p>

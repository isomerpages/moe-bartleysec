before submitting your claims.</p>

submitting claims to Income Insurance for reimbursement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Supporting documents include the medical bill with details of treatment
provided, medication dispensed from the hospital or clinic, showing payment
has been made. There should be no outstanding amount payable.</p>
<p>e) Parents/guardian should, where possible, avoid the use of private hospitals,

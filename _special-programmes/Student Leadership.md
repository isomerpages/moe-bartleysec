**Bartley Secondary School - Student Leadership Development** <br>
At Bartley, we believe that every student has the potential to be a strong self-leader, and a leader for others. As such, the school has identified Student Leadership Development to be one of our key student development platforms. To this end, we have SLD programmes targeted at the whole student body, and for students on our Student Leadership Tracks.

**Leadership Structure** <br>
The school nurtures resilient and responsible leaders by offering all Bartleyans leadership opportunities and leadership development through structured and progressive leadership training programmes. These are brief descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of the different student leader segments.

**Students’ Council (SC)** <br>
The Students’ Council is the voice of the student body and the representative of the school. As such, student councillors serve the school by influencing the student population to live out the school values and motto as well as leading changes to improve the school.

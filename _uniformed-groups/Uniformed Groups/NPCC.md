**About our CCA** <br>
Bartley NPCC unit aims to mould cadets with character and leadership. Cadets can look forward to interesting visits to operational units in the Singapore Police Force. They will attend courses, learn about crime scene investigation, and experience revolver shooting first-hand. In addition, they will also build their courage and tenacity through annual school camps and outdoor camps organised by NPCC HQ.

Welcome to Bartley Secondary School!

Welcome to Bartley Secondary School!

Founded in 1952, the school has a long and rich history of nurturing learners and leaders. We are heartened that our alumni members actively contribute to the progress of the nation in different fields, ranging from public service, civic organisations, business to sports.  Therefore, we envision our current young Bartleyans to be positive agents of change in the future.

We believe in providing as many and diverse learning opportunities as possible for our students. Besides our academic and co-curriculum programmes, we also have our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) to enhance their school experience.  Our ALP, Chemical & Applied Sciences (Fragrance), offers students the additional opportunities to learn STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) through exploration and discovery, offering them a glimpse into STEM which is a new engine of growth to propel our nation’s progress in the future. Our LLP, Community Youth Leadership, provides students with real-life experiences to develop character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, and strengthen their leadership skills. We hope to see new generations of Bartleyans continuing the good work of our old boys and girls to contribute actively to the betterment of our society. Both ALP and LLP are distinctive programmes that enhance our students’ school experience and prepare our students for the future.

It takes a community to nurture our young minds. Our parents, alumni and community partners bring with them a vast pool of experience and expertise that can enrich the development of our Bartleyans.  Hence, we seek to work in partnership with our parents, alumni and community partners to provide relevant, authentic and meaningful learning experiences for our students. 

To all Bartleyans, I would like to encourage you to be courageous to respond to opportunities, optimistic in the face of challenges, respectful in their interactions with others and pursue excellence in becoming men and women of character. I am confident that our Bartleyans can grow to be Learners for Life and Leaders for Others. May you strive to be a blessing to those around you.

I wish each Bartleyan a meaningful journey with us. Facta Non Verba!

Ms Britta Seet

Bartley school of Singapore <br>
Up and coming to the fore, <br>
Let us hail our alma mater ever more. <br> 
Strong and steadfast we will be, <br>
Forge a strong community, <br>
With the links of friendship, <br> 
Love and loyalty <br>

**Chorus** <br>
Let’s cry “Facta Non Verba” <br>
And proclaim it near and far, <br> 
Whether it be work or play <br> 
We’ll go on from day to day, <br> 
And be well-prepared <br> 
To stand up to the fray <br>

Majulah Singapura <br>
Majulah Singapura <br>
That’s the cheer that links <br> 
Our people near and far. <br> 
Singapore will always be, <Br> 
Growing with prosperity, <br>
With the spirit that has <Br>
Made us strong and free. <Br> 

**Chorus** <Br>
Let’s cry “Facta Non Verba” <br>
And proclaim it near and far, <br>
Whether it be work or play <br> 
We’ll go on from day to day, <br> 
And be well-prepared <Br> 
To stand up to the fray <br>

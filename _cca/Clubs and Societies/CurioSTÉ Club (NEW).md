**About our CCA** <br>
CurioSTÉ – a play on the French word, Curiosité, which means curiosity. Our club aims to pique the students’ curiosity for Science, Technology and Engineering.

CurioSTÉ Club is an extension of the broad-based ALP curriculum for students who are interested to delving deeper and acquiring novel knowledge in Science, Technology and Engineering. With strong partnerships with various stakeholders, the club is in a prime position to offer members the opportunities to experience learning in an authentic and innovative environment. In addition to participating in learning journeys and competitions to develop the cognitive aspect of our members, they will also be engaging in VIA activities and leadership development programmes to ensure their holistic development in the CCA.

**About our CCA** <br>
In Netball, members learn the rules of the games, strategies as well as the values of sportsmanship and discipline. Emphasis is also placed on physical conditioning as team members need to be physically prepared for a 40-minute long high intensity game. The team participates in the Interschools Zonal Netball Championships, M1-Netball Challenge League, various carnivals as well as friendly matches with other schools. Each member will have an opportunity to represent the school in at least 1 match a year. Through the games, members will also learn basic umpiring skills.

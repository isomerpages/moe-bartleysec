**About our CCA** <br>
Bartley Secondary School Modern Dance Club was inaugurated in 2016. Dance
members go through twice a week training by full time instructor which focus on
enhancing physical strength, foundational techniques and choreography skills. Beyond
the dance floor, our training cultivates resilience, discipline and team work. The club
comprises of boys and girls who are enthusiastic and passionate in dance. Our focus is
on contemporary techniques but occasionally we expose the dancers to other genre of
dances.

BSS Modern Dance Club boasts a strong performance record. We offer numerous
opportunities for public performances, including school events and competitions like the
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).

<p><strong>About our CCA</strong> 
<br>Bartley NCC (Land) Unit is an all-boys uniform group that nurtures responsible,
resilient and resourceful cadets to become successful citizens through
all kinds of fun and challenging activities.</p>
<p>Cadets have an exclusive opportunity to be trained in handling the SAR
21 rifle in lower secondary and eventually get to experience a live shoot
in upper secondary.</p>
<p>In addition, there are camps and courses conducted by the school and NCC
HQ to train our cadets in their leadership and teamwork skills. Various
fun and exciting activities that they can look forward to are archery,
flying fox, kayaking, paintball, and rock climbing.</p>
<p>NCC (Land) cadets get opportunities to go on overseas expeditions such
as Outward Bound Sabah, Mount Ophir and International Cadet Exchange Programmes
(ICEP) including countries such as India, Brunei, New Zealand, USA, Australia,
and so on.</p>
<p>Cadets can look forward to attaining ranks every year, with the top two
Sec 4 cadets of each cohort attaining the highest rank of Master Sergeant.
We seek to develop our cadets in their leadership skills and help them
to work towards achieving awards for NYAA (National Youth Achievement Award).
All these will contribute towards them getting a distinction in their CCA
grade.</p>

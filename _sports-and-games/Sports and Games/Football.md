**About our CCA** <br>
The Bartley Football team aims to nurture the boys under our charge through football. Utilizing a comprehensive methodology, it aims to develop independent, creative and disciplined individuals who embody the values of sportsmanship.

In training, fun is emphasised as the team members practice moves set within the context of the game to develop their technical and physical skills. They are guided by coaches who bring cutting-edge techniques and drills from top-level academies to support them in their development and decision making, ensuring that the players themselves are at the heart of their own learning process.

The team participates in the National School Games for the B (Under-16s) and C (Under-14s) Divisions and the Inter-school Futsal Championships every year. In addition to this, players are given more exposure through friendlies between schools and clubs. The team also participates in external competitions to give more opportunities to players to get more experience. 

Technology also plays an important role in helping athletes to develop, as cameras are deployed during training sessions and games and uploaded to an online application for players and parents to review their progress. Players are encouraged to identify their own areas of development, and are advised by coaches and teachers on areas for improvement, so that the players develop the intrinsic motivation to keep improving. 

E-CCA programs include match analysis, as well as the introduction of games to build their abilities such as the Football Intelligym to help them develop their understanding of the game and provide them with the ability and vocabulary to discuss football beyond the field. In so doing, we aim to provide lifelong learning for students and to enjoy playing and watching the game.

**About our CCA** <br>
Service Learning Club provides vast opportunities for students to reach out to both their school community and the external community in diverse ways be it to serve the elderly , the physically challenged , raise funds for the needy and to protect the environment they live in by ensuring the eco balance is not endangered. All members gain experience in planning their VIAs and initiating VIAs with teamwork and reflecting on it thereafter to make the necessary improvements. Besides, they also equip themselves with effective communciation skills when interacting with the elderly and the sick. The CCA aims to inculcate and nurture the passion for service as a lifelong skill for the students so that they will always spare a thought for the good of the society they live in and be active citizens.

**SLC 2020** <br>
SLC in 2020! An eventful year indeed ! We saw Covid 19 as an opportunity for us rather than an obstacle! The year rolled on with our annual Chinese New Year VIA celebrations at Tembusu Senior Activity Centre. As customary, some of the Guzheng CCA members with the support of their CCA Teachers, also came on board with us. Our joint VIA for our senior residents audience. Melodious songs from Guzheng performers and our SLC students’ CNY red goodie bags turned out a sweet success!

National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU) Singapore joined us this year in our VIA partnership list. Live On! Tote Bag Designing Competition (National Level) paved an opportunity for us to join hands with NOTU in raising funds for the beneficiaries of the Organ Transplant Unit. In October this year 20 of our SLC students received Certificate of Active Participation for this worthy cause as their designs were shortlisted in this competition. The school also received a plaque for our active participation and partnership with NOTU.

Covid 19 gave us more opportunities to reach out to the needy near and far from us ! Our ECCA sessions gave us more time and space to prepare and execute all our VIAs as planned ! Our mission continues .

A school wide Food Donation Drive in Term 1 saw Bartleyans’ magnanimity ! What a bountiful collection of donations! Deeply appreciated by our beneficiaries from Food From The Heart!

Annual Car Wash by SLC members helped to raise funds for our School Needy Pupil Funds.

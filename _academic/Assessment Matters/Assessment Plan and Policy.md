<h1>Assessment Plan and Policy 2026</h1>
<p>1. The Ministry of Education announced in 2018 changes to school-based
assessment to shift away from over-emphasis on examinations and grades,
and help students discover the joy of learning.</p>
<p>2. In tandem with these changes, there will be only one weighted assessment
per subject per term that counts towards the year-end overall score.&nbsp;
The school will undertake a range of formative assessment (e.g. pop quizzes,
worksheets and homework) and reporting (e.g. termly and semestral progress
reports) to inform and support student learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In addition, there will be no mid-year examination for all levels.</p>
<p>4.<strong> Absence from Weighted Assessment (WA) and Examinations</strong>
</p>
<p>4.1. Absence from WA due to medical reasons.</p>
<p>Students must produce a Medical Certificate (MC) from a doctor registered
with the Singapore Medical Council so that the WA can be reflected as Valid
Reason (VR). The MC must cover the date(s) of assessment that the student
had missed, indicating the diagnosis and that the student is unfit for
the assessment, and should be submitted to his/her Form Teacher as soon
as the student returns to school. Upon receipt of the medical certificate,
the status of the assessment grade will be reflected as “MC”. Proration
of marks, based on the other weighted assessments for the year, will be
computed and reflected in the progress report accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.2. Absence from WA due to non-medical reasons:</p>
<p>For non-medical reasons (for e.g. bereavement in the family), students
must notify the school of their absence through the Form Teacher at the
earliest possible time.&nbsp; If the reason is accepted, the student must
submit a parent’s letter accompanied by relevant supporting documents (e.g.,
death certificate, official appointment letter) immediately upon their
return to school. Once verified, the assessment status will be reflected
as VR. Proration of marks, based on the other weighted assessments for
the year, will be computed and reflected in the progress report accordingly&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp; A student without a medical certificate or a valid reason will
be given&nbsp;<strong><u>zero mark</u></strong>&nbsp;for the paper that
he/she has missed. The status of the assessment grade will be reflected
as Absent (AB). Letters from parents without supporting documents will
not be accepted.<s>&nbsp;</s>
</p>
<p>4.4. While there is no retest or make-up test, students who are absent
from the WAs/ examination will be given the paper for practice when they
return to school.</p>
<p>4.5. WAs and examinations are important checkpoints for students to gauge
their learning progress and for teachers to identify learning gaps and
conduct remediation. Students are expected to put in effort to prepare
and revise for the assessment and be present on days of assessment. Students
who miss more than 25% of the assessment for any subject in a year will
not be eligible for school-based academic awards.</p>
<p>4.6. The school reserves the right to decide on the pro-ration of marks
should the student be absent for parts of the paper, or one or more papers
for a subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.7. In the event that the marks have been pro-rated, due to a valid reason,
the student will not qualify for the position of ‘Top in Subject’.</p>
<p>4.8. <strong>Assessment policy for New Admission/Returning Singaporeans&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>To allow for transition and sufficient time to bridge learning gaps, WAs
for new admissions or returning Singaporeans will only be counted 4 weeks
from their date of entry.</p>
<p>For example, if the student joins the school in week 3, WAs will only
be counted from Week 7 onwards:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Note: This policy applies only to new admission from other education systems. For situations where a student is transferred from another MOE school, policy may not apply.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.<strong> Alternative Assessment (AA)</strong>
</p>
<p>5.1. The school conducts AA such as project work and practical, to provide
opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning that cannot be
directly or meaningfully assessed with just pen-and-paper tests. Through
AA, students are able to demonstrate their learning such as presenting
their viewpoints using different modes of presentation, develop their research
skills, confidence and motivation to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp; <strong>Adherence to submission deadlines for AA tasks is mandatory</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students may submit work up to seven calendar days after the deadline;
however, these late submissions will incur a 5% deduction from the total
possible mark. Any work submitted beyond this seven-day window will be
classified as non-submission and awarded a mark of zero.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Academic Integrity</strong>
</p>
<p>6.1. All AA tasks submitted must be the unaided work of the student. Students
are required to act with integrity by producing their own work, attributing
ideas and information to original authors, acknowledge assistance and effort
of others, and not passing off the work of others’ as one’s own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.2. Students must acknowledge sources of information used in their work,
and this includes the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)<em>. </em>Instructions
for citing sources, including generative AI, can be found in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GWuXu-IhmAwTaBk-MO1eUmZq4BuY7lLz/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a>.</p>
<p>6.3 Use of AI at <strong>Lower Secondary</strong>: At this stage, students
are still learning to take greater ownership in the use of AI to support
their own learning. Thus, the use of generative<em> AI is only permitted when allowed and under the guidance by the subject teacher. </em>If
used, students <strong>must</strong> provide in-text citations and a full
transcript of prompts in the bibliography.</p>
<p>6.4. Use of AI at <strong>Upper Secondary</strong>: At this stage, students
are expected to apply their knowledge of the ethical and responsible use
of AI.&nbsp; Students may use generative AI tools <strong>only when allowed by the subject teacher</strong>.
If used, students <strong>must</strong> provide in-text citations and a full
transcript of prompts in the bibliography.</p>
<p>6.5. Any student who attempts to pass off content that was generated by
AI as one’s own work will be considered as having committed an act of plagiarism
or cheating. For assignments or assessments, zero marks will be awarded
for the work, and the student will face disciplinary consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;Parents’/Guardian’s Support</strong>
</p>
<p>The school firmly believes in a tripartite partnership where parents work
closely with the school to nurture and ensure that our students learn the
right values, skills, attitudes and behaviours. Hence, parents should notify
the school of the reason for their child’s/ward’s absence and highlight
any areas of concern they may have so that these can be addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. We appreciate your assistance in ensuring that your child/ward does
the necessary preparation and revision for the components that he/she will
be assessed on.</p>
<p><strong>9. Assessment Weighting</strong>
</p>
<p>9.1. Please see below for the assessment weighting for Secondary 1 to
3 for the academic year 2026.&nbsp;<em>Assessment weighting applies for all subjects unless otherwise stated.</em>

<p><strong>BARTLEY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK (BCF)</strong> 
<br>The Bartley Curriculum Framework defines the school’s approaches and outcomes
and sets the direction, for excellence in teaching and learning. It guides
the school in delivering a quality student-centric, values-driven and holistic
education.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The BCF is designed to be in a shape of a star and compass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is likened to that of a Polaris or more commonly known as the North
Star. The North Star has been used for well over 2000 years by navigators
to determine both their direction and latitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BCF thus provides the direction for the school in the design and delivery
of its programme, both in curricular and co-curricular areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BCF has 5 parts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Innermost circle for <strong>Values</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The heptagon for <strong>Habits</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hexagon for <strong>Competencies</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 6-pointed star for <strong>Approaches</strong>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wheel for <strong>Mission</strong> and <strong>Value Proposition</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation of the BCF will help deliver the desired outcome of
a Bartleyan education, captured in the wheel at the base of the model</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The BCF is centred on the school’s <strong>CORE VALUES</strong>. These
values form the foundation of our efforts to nurture our students.</p>
<p>Students are also equipped with social-emotional competencies, and 21st
century skills to help them navigate through life successfully. <strong>COMPETENCIES</strong> are
abilities or attributes, described in terms of behaviour, which are key
to highly effective performance.</p>
<p>The school’s effort in curriculum planning and design is based on the <strong>X3-A3 APPROACH</strong>.
For academic programme, the curriculum is designed with the intent to e<strong>X</strong>cite
and engage students in their learning, provide avenues for them to e<strong>X</strong>tend
and apply what they have learnt, and give opportunities for all students
to e<strong>X</strong>cel and experience success. In the co-curricular
domain, the design of the curriculum is tailored to enable students to <strong>A</strong>cquire
knowledge and skills, provide opportunities for them to <strong>A</strong>ct
on what they have learnt, and equip them with skills so that they can be
a champion and <strong>A</strong>dvocate for positive change.</p>
<p>In enacting the curriculum, the school is guided by our <strong>MISSION</strong> of
empowering every Bartleyan to lead with wisdom, serve with humility and
learn with passion. Through this framework, we want to deliver on our <strong>VALUE PROPOSITION</strong> of
nurturing Bartleyans to be Leaders for Others, Learners for Life.</p>
